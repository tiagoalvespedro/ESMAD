                    <h2><strong>Photography & Editorial Design</strong></h2>
                    <h3>Puro</h3>
                    <p>Puro is a project, above all, about the ocean.</p>
                    <p>A photobook that approaches the ocean as the space of research, to understand the dynamics involved inactivities related to the Atlantic. This publication aims to witness the people who dedicate their lives to the sea, analyzing the integration of these humans with nature, discovering the parallelism between the Men of the sea, from the classic fisherman to the contemporary surfer.</p>
                    <p>Portugal has an immemorial relationship with the sea that immediately transports us to the past. The country that, from the sea, gave new worlds to the world. This instinctive reaction leads many Portuguese to associate the ocean with everything but the natural resource and economic asset that it essentially is.</p>
                    <p>This photographic collection wants to explore the connection that the Atlantic provides, specifically, understand the relation between surfing and fishing community. Surfers and fishermen live so close but in completely different realities, both constantly in the middle of the water. Fishermen look for the marine life that lives where the waves break, while surfers enjoy the sculpted waves that the ocean creates.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Branding & Web Design</strong></h2>
                    <h3>The Fisher Man</h3>
                    <p>This project represents a fictional branding concept for Fisher Man restaurant, a coastal culinary haven that combines rustic elegance with maritime heritage.</p>
                    <p>The challenge was to create an online presence as if it were a real client, drawing upon the creative power of AI to develop a compelling backstory for this imagined establishment.</p>
                    <p>The design embodies a harmonious blend of warmth and sophistication, featuring an inviting color palette, rustic maritime elements, and a classic serif font. The website encompasses sections for menu presentation, reservations and an About Us page that narrates the restaurant's rich history, inspired by the founder's journey from fisherman to renowned chef. Each element is thoughtfully crafted to immerse visitors in the ambiance of The Fisher Man, from the seafood-centric menu to the latest design trends. This project demonstrates how AI can aid in crafting a captivating narrative, allowing us to design for an imaginary client as if they were real, breathing life into a culinary concept that exists solely in the realm of imagination.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Visual Identity</strong></h2>
                    <h3>Ericeira</h3>
                    <p>Since Ericeira exists, it is a land of people that live alongside the ocean. The locals have always been identified with experiences linked to the Atlantic sea, descendants of a long lineage of men and women who have found on this wild coast the meaning of their lives and the reason for their existence.</p>
                    <p>It was with these thoughts in mind that the concept for Ericeira's new visual identity was created. The relation with the sea was essential and became the central element throughout the design process. Demonstrating it in a subtle way in the letters that make up the logo, giving a sense of continuity and movement. This identity can modify itself with different types of swells, reminding the seven world-class waves that this coastal region concentrates. The chromatic palette comes from a meticulous study of the territory, connecting the ocean and environment with the people, developing a harmonious interaction between Man and Nature.</p>
